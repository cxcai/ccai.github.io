I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/  T.~Tony Cai] and Professor [http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/ Hongzhe Li]. I obtained my Ph.D.~in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University in 2021, advised by Professor [http://yuxinchen2020.github.io Yuxin Chen] and Professor [https://ee.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor H.~Vincent Poor]  . I have also worked with Sergio Verd√∫ at Princeton. Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2016. \n\n
I am broadly interested in theories and algorithms for high-dimensional statistics, optimization and machine learning. \n\n 
Here is my [CV_ChangxiaoCai.pdf CV].
