I am an Assistant Professor in the [https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/ Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering] at the [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan]. \n

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/  T.~Tony Cai] and [http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/ Hongzhe Li]. I obtained my Ph.D.~in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University in 2021, advised by [http://yuxinchen2020.github.io Yuxin Chen] and [https://ee.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor H.~Vincent Poor]. I have also worked with Sergio Verd√∫ at Princeton. Prior to this, I received my B.E.~in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2016. \n

I am broadly interested in theories and algorithms for mathematical data science, high-dimensional statistics, optimization and machine learning. \n

I am recruiting motivated Ph.D.~students interested in statistics, optimization and machine learning. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with your CV.
